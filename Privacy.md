OctoDroid Privacy Policy
========================

What information do we collect?
-------------------------------
For connecting to GitHub, OctoDroid does not store your user name and/or password.
Instead, you are asked to log in to GitHub in a browser, which generates a
(revokable) access token which is then stored on the device.
Additionally, OctoDroid stores bookmarks you create locally on the device.

What do we use your information for?
------------------------------------
The stored access token(s) is/are used for authenticating your actions in the app
towards GitHub's servers. The stored bookmarks are only used for populating the
bookmarks list.

How do we protect your information?
-----------------------------------
The collected data is only stored on the local device and not shared with any outside
party, with the exception of access tokens being transmitted to GitHub's servers as
described above.

Your consent
------------
By using the app, you consent to this [privacy policy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slapperwan/gh4a/master/Privacy.md).


Changes to our Privacy Policy
-----------------------------
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will publish any related change on
this page.
